# LateCommerApp REST API

### Introduction
LateCommerApp is an application that takes an employeeâ€™s Name, Email, Address and Time of arrival. The application then aggregates all the input data (including paginated data) and shows how much every employee in the list owes along with other data in order of the employee with highest bill (use any field).
(Based on the time of arrival of each employee assume that for every 1 minute of lateness the employee owes 0.2$)
